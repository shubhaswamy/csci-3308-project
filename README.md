## Our Project:
RequestIT is a form created for CU Boulder's OIT department. The OIT department does not have a real organized way for students to request software for OIT to install, so we created one for them! With a sleek homepage and a way to sign up and login, students can easily find the software they are looking for. Their request is sent to a database that OIT can access so they can install it for them. RequestIT is smooth and beautiful way to request software for the school!
