## Our Project:
RequestIT is a form created for CU Boulder's OIT department. The OIT department does not have a real organized way for students to request software for OIT to install, so we created one for them! With a sleek homepage and a way to sign up and login, students can easily find the software they are looking for. Their request is sent to a database that OIT can access so they can install it for them. RequestIT is smooth and beautiful way to request software for the school!


## Repo Organization:
Our repository is organized into many folders and subfolers on Github. We chose Github because we had worked with it during our labs and found it very useful in constructing a repository where everyone could share, edit, and upload files. Every folder we created holded a sum of files that went togehter, named effectively so that any files could be found easily and quickly. Any files outside of the folders were named descriptively and every push was also given a description of the purpose. All of these descriptions were helpful in navigating the numerous amounts of files that we had uploaded to our Git repo. 

## Finding and Building Documents
Described above, our repository is organized by descriptive names of files and purposes of each commit. You can use the search bar to easily type in codewords that will show files with only those certain codewords in it. This makes finding files very easy and accessible. As for building documents, we built most of our documents outside of the repository and committed them once we made the changes to the original document. 

## Builing, Running, and Testing Code
Building code happened in either Sublime and the VM for Computer Science, or in a code runner like Atom, or MySQL. Running the code also took place on the VM, Sublime, or another coderunner. The terminal is always the most useful application to run and test code. This was true for all of the aspects of our project like the html, test cases, and database. Testing the code and running the code took place in the terminal and retrun with errors or with a successful test. Testing was done until all the code would execute correctly.
